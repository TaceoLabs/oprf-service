//! # TACEO:OPRF Umbrella Crate
//!
//! `taceo-oprf` bundles all TACEO:OPRF sub-crates into a single crate
//! so you can include only the features you need, without importing
//! each crate separately.
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - [`client`] – high-level OPRF client functionality (requires the `client` feature).
//! - [`core`] – core OPRF primitives and cryptography (requires the `core` feature).
//! - [`dev_client`] – developer-focused client utilities for testing and mocking
//!   (requires the `dev-client` feature, implies `client`).
//! - [`service`] – OPRF service nodes, background tasks, and orchestration
//!   (requires the `service` feature).
//! - [`types`] – shared types and structs across OPRF crates
//!   (requires the `types` feature).
//! - [`anvil`] – test helpers for deploying the OPRF contracts to a local
//!   Anvil devnet (requires the `anvil` feature; not included in `full`).
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! Each module is optional. Enable only the modules you need to reduce
//! compile time and dependencies.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! taceo-oprf = { version = "0.7.1", features = ["client", "core"] }
//! ```
//!
//! The feature `full` enables all modules with their transitive deps (except the test feature `anvil`).
//!
//! ### Transitive sub-crate features
//!
//! The umbrella forwards each sub-crate feature as its own flag so consumers
//! can opt in or out without importing the individual crates. All of these use
//! the weak-dependency syntax (`dep?/feature`) and therefore do **not** activate
//! the parent crate on their own — the corresponding crate-selection feature
//! (`core`, `service`, `types`) must also be enabled.
//!
//! | Umbrella feature | Forwarded to            | Notes                               |
//! |------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
//! | `postgres`       | `oprf-service/postgres` | On by default via `full`            |
//! | `chain`          | `oprf-types/chain`      | On by default via `full`            |
//!
//! The `anvil` feature is not forwarded from a sub-crate; it enables the
//! [`anvil`] module directly and pulls in `alloy`, `eyre`, and `serde_json`.
//! It is opt-in only and, unlike the modules above, is **not** enabled by
//! `full`.
